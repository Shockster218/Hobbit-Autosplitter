## About
Tired of having to reach over and split during a run? Want to have a great estimate of your loadless time instantly after completing your run? Hobbit Autosplitter was made with all these issues in mind; never
have to worry about taking your hands off the controller during your best runs. With an average variance of less than half a second, Hobbit Autosplitter will consistently and quickly give you real-time feedback
of your run with **loadless times**. Hobbit Autosplitter was made with any and all categories in mind, even including support for mid-level checkpoints, such as the Thief Split for any%.
